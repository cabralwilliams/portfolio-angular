            <p>Greetings!  My name is Cabral Williams, and I am a developer (I guess that I can call myself that now) who shied away from taking the introductory computer science course freshman year in college about a quarter of a century ago because <i>what is this strange thing, this internet?  It'll never catch on!</i>  I do wish that I had had the foresight to know how much I would enjoy coding and how much I was wrong back then!  I have dabbled in a number of coding languages on my own in the past (VBA, Python, Java, C#), but I am happy that I finally made the decision to take a more structured course.  And, as an homage to a certain movie that came out during my college days and as a way to celebrate the resurrection of that movie franchise, I decide that this was the one appropriate theme for this new portfolio.</p>
